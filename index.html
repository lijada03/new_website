  <h5> Background </h5>
  <p>Robin never had the easiest life. For the first six years of his life, he was a stray dog who spent his time in jungles and by smaller neighborhoods. He was unfortunately hit by a car and was taken in to a vet. He had broken one of his leg and needed rehabilitation. Animal shelters in Singapore are almost always at full capacity, so Robin ended up living at a sawmill factory. The owner of this factory really liked dogs and hired a woman to take care of over 50 dogs in the extra space in the factory. The conditions weren't great. There was never enough food for all the dogs, so rice would be mixed in with their food. Without enough nutrients, Robin and many other dogs ended up with weight problems after eating more than they should have. With the overwhelming amount of dogs, none of them recieved adequate attention or care. He spent two more years at this factory, growing somewhat comfortable with humans.</p>

  <h5>Adoption</h5>
  <p> My family has always been a suitable candidate for pets. We have the space, time and money to take care of animals. At the beginning of quarantine, with little to do, we decided to adopt a dog. I was put in charge of this process and decided we should adopt an older, larger dog, as they are often neglected. An older, more calm dog would also fit my family well. My father and I drove to this sawmill factory we had heard of from an animal activist. After seeing many of the dogs, most of whom were quite feral, a chunky dog meambled to my side and started nuzzling my leg, leaving dirt all over it. I think that was when I fell in love. I was like, this is him. This is the dog we have to take home. His name, the lady working there told me, was Robin.

  <h5> Joy</h5>
  <p>I cannot tell you how much joy Robin has brought to my life. Suddenly back at home, I was confronted with many of my triggers. My mental health was in a state it hadn't been in years. I spent weeks in my room, with someone bringing me food to my door so I wouldn't starve. It was genuinely an abysmal time. Robin changed that. Suddenly I had someone to take care of. He was my responsibility to train and accompany, at least until he was used to the house. I found that he had almost as much anxiety as me. He was fearful of new situations and new people. He would panic unbearably when feeling trapped, even in a harness. He would shake violently during thunderstorms. So much of this was attributed to his difficult past. And yet, despite this all, he was the best possible boy. After a few days, he became the gentlest dog, with unending patience. He adapted to life with us so quickly. Every morning he would wait between our doors and eagerly accompany the first person to greet him. He is a very lazy dog. He loves to sit in the sun or on my carpet and watch me for hours. Once in a while he'll always make sure to nuzzle and check up on me. Perhaps it was his presence or his kindred spirit, but I managed to function at a somewhat normal rate. Most touchingly, whenever I cried or had a panic attack, he would immediately lean against me (even climbing on my bed, which he wasn't technically allowed to do) and let me hug him even though hugs usually make him panic. When my sister and I returned to the US, he sat between our rooms for most of our days waiting. It did break my heart a little bit, but he does have a surprisingly strong bond with both of my parents which is hopefully comforting. I think his huge heart despite his difficult past was what really touched me. I miss him a lot and I can't wait to see him again.

   <h5> A Brother? </h5>
   <p>
     A very new development - my parents bought a Shiba Inu puppy the day before I write this. He's 10 months old, named Pelé after the Brazilian soccer player. He's incredibly fast and terribly adorable. He and Robin are very cautious around one another, but they hopefully will grow closer with time. I look forward to meeting Pelé!
